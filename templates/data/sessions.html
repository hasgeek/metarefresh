However, in doing so, we often overlook and break the principles that the web has been built on over the past two decades. Even if we choose to turn blind towards philosophies, standards or doing things the right way, we simply cannot ignore the proliferation and diversity of devices and user agents today.</p><p>This workshop will revisit the spirit of the web — understanding what makes the web special and how to embrace the principle of progressive enhancement to build robust websites. We shall create a very simple project starting from scratch and build it in layers so that the final code works flawlessly across many different systems and devices — both feature-rich and featureless.</p><p>“The best way to be future-proof is to be backwards compatible.”</p>'

And all the frameworks have added support for partially responsive sites.</p><p>Yet, too many people are doing it in the wrong way. We\'re using frameworks that make all the decisions for us. But almost all of them follow just a single basic pattern, multiple columns that merge into a single column. And this results in layouts that aren\'t really that great.</p><p>Can we do better? There are numerous Responsive Design patterns, and yet we don\'t use them because they seem difficult to implement. But they are not.</p><p>In this workshop, you\'ll learn how to make websites that provide a great experience on every device. We are going to learn how to build a few different and unique responsive design patterns from scratch. In the process you\'ll learn techniques that you will be able to use in your own projects and with any framework.</p>'
