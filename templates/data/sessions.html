Even if we choose to turn blind towards philosophies, standards or doing things the right way, we simply cannot ignore the proliferation and diversity of devices and user agents today.</p><p>This workshop will revisit the spirit of the web — understanding what makes the web special and how to embrace the principle of progressive enhancement to build robust websites. We shall create a very simple project starting from scratch and build it in layers so that the final code works flawlessly across many different systems and devices — both feature-rich and featureless.</p><p>“The best way to be future-proof is to be backwards compatible.”</p>'
