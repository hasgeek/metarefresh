      <p>The 2016 edition is over. Meta Refresh will be back next year.</p>
      <p>
        Meta Refresh is a conference on user experience for the web. Speakers in this event are working web designers and developers who describe how their work has advanced the state of the web in the past year. As a speaker, you are expected to present original work that your peers — the event’s audience — recognise as being notable enough to deserve a stage.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2015, the event focussed on (a) Design from a web engineering standpoint, and (b) Enhancing the state of web experiences on mobile devices with their many constraints.

        Today, we’re in a world where smartphones outnumber desktops and laptops put together. It is imperative for nearly every business with an online presence today to have a smooth mobile experience.

        Wearables – smart watches and devices – have now burst upon the scene. They track fitness goals, tell people when to eat, and are especially useful as notification centers.

        Desktop apps are not going away any time soon, though. Despite the fact that a sizeable portion of the existing user base for a product are accessing its website only through a handheld device, people continue to work and shop on their desktops.
